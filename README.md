# Negative-controls-in-MR

This repository contains R code used to implement the real-data analysis of the paper "Using Negative Control Outcomes to Detect Selection Bias in Mendelian Randomization Studies". The paper is available as a pre-print [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.30.26345215v1).

The analysis uses summary-level genetic data from [Schoeler et al. (2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01579-9). The datasets are freely available for download [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QMq9Y_BDK-9o0TlaJL-fwaqQl4BbR6Ek).

The R code used to run the analysis is included in the file "Negative_Controls_Application.R". It requires the user to have downloaded summary-level data from the above repository. The results are contained in file "Negative_Controls_Application.RData".
